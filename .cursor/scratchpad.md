## üîß TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY & SCALABILITY ANALYSIS

### High Feasibility (Ready for MVP in 2-3 weeks):
1. **Base Blast** - Tap-to-earn mechanics are proven and simple to implement
2. **Meme Coin Madness** - Fantasy trading using existing Zora/Uniswap infrastructure
3. **Prediction Coinhouse** - Can use existing prediction market contracts

### Medium Feasibility (MVP in 4-6 weeks):
1. **Base Battle Royale** - Requires real-time voting and elimination systems
2. **Coin Creator Olympics** - Needs custom voting/competition infrastructure
3. **Flash Mob Minting** - Requires coordination systems and real-time tracking

### Lower Feasibility (MVP in 8+ weeks):
1. **Onchain Summer Olympics** - Requires multiple mini-games and complex competition systems

### Scalability Considerations:

**For High Concurrent Users (10K+):**
- Use Base's sub-cent transaction costs for micro-actions
- Implement batching for non-critical operations
- Use off-chain computation with on-chain settlement
- Leverage Base's target 250 Mgas/s capacity by 2025

**Database & Infrastructure:**
- Real-time leaderboards: Redis + PostgreSQL
- User sessions: WebSocket connections through Base infrastructure
- File storage: IPFS for content, Base for metadata
- Caching: CDN for static assets, Redis for dynamic data

**Gas Optimization:**
- Batch user actions where possible
- Use CREATE2 for predictable contract addresses
- Implement merkle proofs for bulk operations
- Leverage Base's planned <1s, <1¬¢ transaction goals

**Security & Anti-Cheat:**
- Rate limiting for tap-to-earn mechanics
- Sybil resistance through wallet history analysis
- Smart contract audits for all money-handling functions
- Multi-signature wallets for prize pool management

### Technical Stack Recommendations:

**Frontend**: React/Next.js with Base's OnchainKit for wallet integration
**Backend**: Node.js/Express with Redis for real-time features
**Blockchain**: Base Mainnet with Zora SDK integration
**Database**: PostgreSQL for user data, Redis for real-time state
**File Storage**: IPFS for content, Base for metadata and ownership
**Analytics**: Custom dashboard for monitoring user engagement and viral metrics
